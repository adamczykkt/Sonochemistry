# Sonochemistry
This project was created for data analysis for my master's dissertation.

Python 3.6.1

## Before running
To run the program file run_analysis.py must be launched. Data can be loaded seperatly ([1]) or collectively ([2]). If data has been processed before, it is loaded from *.kinfit and *.ctsfit files. If not, it will be processed at the first execution.
